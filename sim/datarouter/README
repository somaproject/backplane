An attempt to test the event router. We care about:

1. proper device sequencing
2. That the right bytes happen at the right time
3. that we very clearly codify our assumptions. 

We run the cycle for four ticks, and we populate the device fully with
events.

There is an array of event addresses, which we rotate right every
ECYCLE. This is somewhat randomized to allow for full coverage.
The data transmitted by device n is n*3 through n*3+7. 

We have one process to check the validity of the output data, and one
to check the validity of the ecycle matrix.

Test the NetControl interface

First we test the ethernet interface with the nicserialio



OLD NETCONTROL:


This is our attemt to verify that our network control settings are
working as we expect them to.

The sending device here has ID 0x04, and the receiving (uut) has 0x01. 


1. send a no-op event and verify we don't respond

2. Network settings: 
We test this by writing to, and check for the update-event from, 
the following net settings: 

MAC
IP broadcast address
IP address

3. we write some values to all of the counters ,and then read back 
RXIOCRCERROR
TXCNT6 
TXLEN6

4. We then wait a while and try and read the broadcast values.

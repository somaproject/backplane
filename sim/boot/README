Test of the boot configuration; we're going to try and test our boot
configuration.

We're using our previous MMC component as a boot interface, and
reading events out of a textfile.

The problem is that the operations which we coordinate occur on a very
long timescale.


Ideally we'll want to test: 
1. Can we boot at all? i.e. does it work in even a retarded sense. 
2. Can we properly boot multiple devices? 
3. Does ADDR, len, and mask work properly? 
4. How do we handle multiple attempts to boot? 

 
MMCFPGAboot: 
can we give it an address and a subset of code and have it DTRT?

Test of the boot configuration; we're going to try and test our boot
configuration.

The problem is that the operations which we coordinate occur on a very
long timescale.

Ideally we'll want to test: 
1. Can we boot at all? i.e. does it work to boot a single event
2. Can we properly boot multiple devices? 
3. Does ADDR, len, and mask work properly? 
4. How do we handle multiple attempts to boot?

Test the clock-frame serializer. Can we put in a series of data words
and get appropriately-framed words out?

We simply put in the digits 0-1023 and then try and read them out; the
goal is to acquire a clock-frame lock inside of some small number of
clock cycles and then read a robust 1024 words out.

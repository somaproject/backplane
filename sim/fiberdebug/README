There are basically two sets of functionality we care about here:
Event TX and RX.


To generate the behavioral for the coregen 8b10b encoders: 

coregen -b decode8b10b.xco
coregen -b encode8b10b.xco


-----------------------------------------------------------------
Event TX
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Event TX is tested by sending a series of events to verify that we can
TX the bits.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Event RX
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We use the "Serialize" component, generating packets that look as
follows:

for cmd in range(10):
   for j in range(10):
     send packet with a data base of 0x1000 * j

this should result in 11 packets per cmd set


The serialize'd data stream is generated by makeserial.py.

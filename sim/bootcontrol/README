This is our boot control interface; we mate bootcontrol with rxeventfifo to test that we're properly receiving events and responding to them. 


To that extent, we test: 
1. what happens when we send no-op events? 
2. what happens when we send a valid boot event? do we extract out the correct fields? 
3. 


Our current attempts are not working and this has become increasingly frustrating. 

1. Cycle 1: transmit a no-op
2. verify we receive no response event on the next cycle
3. Transmit a boot event
4. verify at some point in the future we receive a boot done event
5. transmit multiple boot events
6. verify that we receive errors
7. verify that we receive the "boot done" event

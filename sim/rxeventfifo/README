This is the test of the RX FIFO; 


What do we want to test? 

1. event sequencing: Can we read a single event? 
2. Event simultaneity: can we read an event while we're writing more events? 
3. Do we properly handle the no-op case? 
4. do we properly wrap-around? 


We generate a fake series of events with the high byte being the event source ID, and the low bytes counting 0->5.

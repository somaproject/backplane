This is a test of the mmc fpga boot interface. 

The first test is a functional one: can we make it work at all? 

We will create a simulated array of decoders and monitor the various
state transitions.

* simpleFPGA: 
Part of the question is, how do we get an FPGA to boot and verify that
it has booted properly? We need to verify proper PROGRAM assertion and then read out the correct blocks. 

We create simpleFPGA; when it receives a "start" signal it will verify a proper boot sequence with the correct length and words, and then assert its VALIDBOOT line upon completion. 


Then, we will try and boot the following: 

boot(submask, start, blocklen, addr)

Then we wait to see if that actually boots

How to test our data lock capabilities: 

To get data to test:
1. generate two random bitstrings, an enable bitstring and a datasrc bitstring, with the data bitstring truly random, and the enable bitstring 1 90% more often than it's 0. 
2. compute a "data bitstream" by selecting the relevant bits from the dataasrc bitstream.

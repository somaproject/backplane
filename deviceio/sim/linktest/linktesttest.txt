Test of our serialization; we generate the two separate clocks, and
then try and acquire the bits. Our test vector input is just a counter. 

We test the result by waiting for the appearance of each number; since
the bits are shifted in LSB first there's never a case where we'll
have a collision, I.e. we'll never mistake the shifted input of n+1 for n.

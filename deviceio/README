This is the set of code and docs dealing with how we communicate between the backplane and devices. 

We have four modules: 
serialtx : serial transmission
serialrx : serial reception
devicerx: standardize event rx interface for devices
devicetx: standardized event and data TX for devices
serclock: clock interface; takes in 125 MHz clock and does a dance


This describes two modules for the LVDS serial interface, the
canonical transmitter and receiver. These are designed to be used in
all SOMA devices to communicate. This also includes our 8b/10b code,
if/whenever that is completed. 

The directories are organized as follows:

docs/  all docs 


tests/ hardware-synthesizable test modules for timing and testing in the physical universe

sim/ simulations of each module

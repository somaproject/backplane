This is the set of code and docs dealing with how we communicate between the backplane and devices. 

we have the serial 

This describes two modules for the LVDS serial interface, the
canonical transmitter and receiver. These are designed to be used in
all SOMA devices to communicate. This also includes our 8b/10b code,
if/whenever that is completed. 

The directories are organized as follows:

tests/ hardware-synthesizable test modules for timing and testing in the physical universe

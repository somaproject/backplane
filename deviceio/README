This contains the device-side interface for devices to communicate
with the devicelink to the backplane.

We do not attempt to explain the protocol in detail here, that is done
in the actual backplane documentation.


There are essentially three components: 

1. devicelink: The physical/link layer

2. A more complex dual-link interface module to handle the higher
layer operations and allow simple event/data interface modules


The directories are organized as follows:

docs/  all docs 

tests/ hardware-synthesizable test modules for timing and testing in the physical universe

sim/ simulations of each module

This contains the device-side interface for devices to communicate with the devicelink to the backplane. 

There are essentially three components: 

1. devicelink: The physical/link layer

2. A more complex dual-link interface module to handle the higher
layer operations and allow simple event/data interface modules


The directories are organized as follows:

docs/  all docs 


tests/ hardware-synthesizable test modules for timing and testing in the physical universe

sim/ simulations of each module

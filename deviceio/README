This describes two modules for the LVDS serial interface, the
canonical transmitter and receiver. These are designed to be used in
all SOMA devices to communicate. This also includes our 8b/10b code,
if/whenever that is completed. 

The directories are organized as follows:

docs/  all docs and schematics

rx.vhdl/ all vhdl related to the RX components

tx.vhdl/ all vhdl related to the TX components

tests/ hardware-synthesizable test modules for timing and testing in the physical universe

sim/ simulations of each module

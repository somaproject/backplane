This is a simple, under-documented test of our ability to serialize
and deserialize a bitstream using the National/TI PHY on a device, by
default synthesized for the SerialIO Proto Board.

The serdes test is really really simple; we just shift out N bits and
then verify that we were able to shift out the N bits. The only
challenge here is that even at the slowest rate, we're looking at 300
MHz-level signals, so we need to use the DDR output registers.

We serialize a block of data of N bytes with the appropate clock start
and stop bits, as well as providing a reference clock to the DES.

Keep in mind that you need a SATA crossover cable to test that this
actually works; there is tremendous device polarity.

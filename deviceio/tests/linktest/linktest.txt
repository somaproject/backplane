This is our instantiable link test. 

The link test itself is simple; we simply serialize out the bits on one side of the block ram and test that those are the bytes we receive on the other (in the other clock domain). 

The status LEDs are:

LEDPOWER: Flashes to show system is down. uh, I mean on. 
LEDERROR: high for any inbound packets with errors
LEDVALID : high if the past 150 ms of events were valid

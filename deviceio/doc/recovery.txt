For starters, we're going to create a test jig composed of both
elements for behavioral simulation. 

The question is, how well does it work across timing and jitter?  we'd
like to run it with a bunch of different test vectors as we sweep the
clock in some set of clock frequencies.

We'd also like to investigate the roll of jitter.

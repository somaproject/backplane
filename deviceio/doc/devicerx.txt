This is the device receiver. 

Our IO mechanisms

Possible IO methods and desired guarantees: 

1. following an event cycle, all read events are a part of that cycle
2. the device can never stall /override the output sequence. 
3. there aren't complex implicit timing requirements on The Device


The only solution I can seem to arrive at is something like the previous eventbus interface, but with the filtering done ahead of time. 

Event receiver buffer:
1. based on the EA bits, writes or not-writes the event
2. Is responsible for crossing clock domains
3. has a RESET that is called when not in use, or if an error is detected

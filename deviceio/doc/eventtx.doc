To transmit an event, something in a different (Application) clock domain writes a contiguous burst of event data, 17 bytes. 

The KCHAR input is for setting the first char of this send. 

The interface is relatively simple, we register the input 17 bytes using a byte-wide shift register, and then sequentially read off those bytes in the TXBYTECLK domain using a simple counter/mux configuration.

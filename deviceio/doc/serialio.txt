The serialization of Event and Data packets maps to OSI levels 3 and
below. This document describes the physical medium used, the bit and
byte encoding scheme, and modules written to allow for their
interaction.

This here JUST DISCUSSES THE ACTUAL SERIAL INTERFACE

We use a 100-ohm differential impedance SATA connector, in both
backplane and cable connections; each LVDS pair is unidirectional with
an encoded bitrate of 250 Mbps.

We wanted the device to easily synthesize in a Xilinx Spartan-3 FPGA,
the FPGA of choice for Soma. Restrictions were thus placed on our
manner of deserialiation. We choose to exploit the Spartan-3's
abundant clock manipulation resources to allow a receiver to
oversample the data stream.

The bitstream is 8b/10b encoded because the codec is 

1. no longer patented 

2. guarantees clock transitions for our synchrnization efforts

3. widely understood 

4. has embedded punctuation to allow framing and out-of-band
   signalling with minimal effort, including K28.5, which allows for
   easy byte locking

5. Xilinx has an easy-to-use implementation -- in time, we hope to
   replace this with native IP for a truly Free Solution

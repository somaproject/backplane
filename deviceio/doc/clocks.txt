This is a nice explanation of our clock timing requirements. 

We want 50k event cycles per second. 
We want 40 12-byte events per second. 
That means we effectively want at least 24.0 MB/sec
However, we also want a TX clock that's a multiple of 50e3, because we want to be able to have identical-length frames for each event and an integral number of them per second. 

We want to encode using 8b/10b. This means our TX bitrate is 1.25 times our data bitrate -- at least 240 Mbps. But we also want some header. 

Our solution is to feed in a clock rate of 125 MHx; we double it to 250 MHz and use -that- as our TX bitrate. This results in: 

A byte rate of 25 MB/sec
an event cycle that is 500 bytes long
40*12 = 480 bytes of event paylod per cycle and a 20-byte "who's who" header


So, when it's all said and done:

CLKIN: 125 MHz
TXCLK : 250 MHz
TXBYTECLK: 25 MHz
RXCLK: 258.06 MHz
RXCLK90: 258.06 MHz, shifted by 90 degrees
RXBYTECLK: RXCLK / 10

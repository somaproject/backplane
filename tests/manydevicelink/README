This lets us synthesize and test the devicelink of all devices. 

Our test bitstream will send 0-255 in 8b/10b-encoded streams, with a
k28.5 header. We will attempt to RX the same stream as well; the
device can simply implement a loopback if it so wishes.

We will use the USER registers of the JTAG interface to output the
status of the device. For each device we read out an 8-bit number
(8*20 bits in total) being the number of time units the device has
been running with lock HIGH. If lock is low, this is 0. In general,
this will be "seconds". 

This is designed to be used with
backplane/deviceio/tests/deviceloopback

Currently it will work with any device on the bus. 

-- time measurement 

Associated with each device is a counter in the
uptimearray array. When UPTIMETICK goes high (~1sec) it is
incremented.

-- jtag readout

These are all read out in a block. We use the USER1 instruction (0xC2), and
we read out the number of seconds each channel has been "up". Note
this obviously wraps at 256.

This is an attempt to synthesize and then test the device link of all
the external devices.

Since we have limited output diagnostic information we will use the
network data pins as our tests.

Our test bitstream will send 0-255 in 8b/10b-encoded streams, with a
k28.5 header. We will attempt to RX the same stream as well; the
device can simply implement a loopback if it so wishes.

The "link valid" pins are sent to DIN0-15 and DOUT0-15


The first 16 TX devices are DSPboards 0-15, which are the only ones we
care about at the moment.

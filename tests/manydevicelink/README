This is an attempt to synthesize and then test the device link of all the external devices. 

Since we have limited output diagnostic information we will use the network data pins as our tests. 

Our test bitstream will send 0-255 in 8b/10b-encoded streams, with a k28.5 header. We will attempt to RX the same stream as well; the device can simply implement a loopback if it so wishes.

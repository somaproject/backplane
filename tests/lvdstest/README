This is designed to be a (very) simple high-speed serial integrity
test, which will simply test our ability to send high-speed serial
bits over our LVDS interface. 

We simply send out a stream of N bits and then try and capture them
and simply verify that we're reading the same N bits over and over again. 

This is also designed to be somewhat of a primitive test of our
deserialize module.




On the core->device transmit side:

1. we send a clock-frame-encoded 360 Mbps data stream consisting of a 4 10-bit repeating sequence. 

On the device:

The device receives the 360 Mbps data stream which it turns into a 30
Mhz 10-bit wide stream.

The device verifies: 
   every 4 words are identitical 
   no word is all 0s or all 1s (to prevent "all zeros") error



device => core side:

The device then turns around and sends a 30 MHz x 5 DDR 10bit data
stream, consisting of 4 10-bit words. 

The deserializer deserializes these bits, and the resulting 30 MHz
data stream is
   -- verified to have at least one 1 and one 0 per word
   -- have the same 40 bits every cycle


* Clocking

On the core side:
CLKIN: input 60 MHz clock
clktx, clktxint : clk0 on txdcm
clkbittxint, clkbittx : 360 MHz clock for bit transmit

clkrx, clkrxint : clk0 on rxdcm
clkbitrxint, clkbitrx : 300 MHz clock for bit rx
clkwrxint, clkwrx : 30 MHz clock word receive

Here we generate a series of event packets via the linux UDP/IP stack
and attempt to transmit them; capture them with tcpdump; and then test
and make sure they look like what we were expecting.



Run eventgen.py and capture the pending packets tcpdump

sudo tcpdump src host 192.168.0.2 and ip broadcast -t -xx -s 2000 > data.tcpdump 

or 
tcpdump  src host 192.168.0.2 and  udp -t -xx -s 2000 > data.tcpdump 

This gives us: 
  events.txt : the events, in a vhdl-readable format
  data.tcpdump : the tcpdump output of the udp-encoded packets encoded by the linux udp/ip stack

or 

    


Then run dumpparse.py which will: 
  1. extract out the UDP frames
  2. normalize the IP header: remove the sequence number and set the checksum to zero
  3. clear the UDP checksum
  4. packetize it in a format that we can read / validate in vhdl

This is our attempt to make sure the throughput on the data interface is what we expect AND that we can detect a fifo overflow. 

We begin by having \signal{delay}, the output interpacket delay, be something rediculously high like 20 us. We TX a ton of packets and wait until we get 5 fifowerrors, then we decrease delay to 1 ns and try and read packets as fast as we can. 

We check to make sure that we only have 5 missing packets in our output stream.

The unit tests for the data memory interface arbitration. 

1. do we have correct FIFO operation? Are packets acquired from the
input interface transmitted out the output interface, in the correct
order?

2. If the output fifo is stalled, do we still correctly acquire the data? How long can it be stalled for? 

3. How do retx-requests work? do they work at all? 
   remember, if a packet is more than 256 tx-s old, we shouldn't be
able to retx it, or more correctly, we should be able to request a
retx for any of the past 256 packets.


To test this, we generate simulated behavior...

1. we generate a random array of N = 1000 data packets to test
with. Each of these packets has a sequential packet num.

2. To test retransmission we have some retx-req rate rReTX, say 0.1. 
   That is the probability that we'll request a retx at this 
   particular packet. 
   If we do request a packet, we'll request any one of the previous 250 sent packets for a retx.

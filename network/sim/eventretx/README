Here we attempt to test and verify that the event tx and event retx
components interface properly with the retxbuffer interface and dram.

Modules implicated include: 

eventretxresponse
eventtx
retxbuffer
memddr2
inputcontrol

What to test: 

1. Do retransmission requests degrade gracefully? I.e. if I flood the
system with ReTX requests, do I still get out all the primary events
that I want?

2. If I flood the system with ReTX requests, are all of the
transmitted packets still placed in the eventReTX buffer?


Event input: 

We write full events (all N devices transmitting) every ecycle and try
and transmit. We verify that these are correct. It's impossible for us
to test wrap-arround because that's 320 ms of events, and I'm not
going to wait that long for the sime to run.

Retransmission

We have a "retx program" that we generated in python, which will
consist of a seriels of lines:

N

which will wait until ecycle # N before requesting packet with
sequence id ID.


eventrxdecode: receives an event and then extracts out the sequence
and the timestamp of each included event

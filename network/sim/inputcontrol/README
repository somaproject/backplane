Here we take dumps from ethereal and use them to check and see if we
can identify the relevant packets.

We have various queries, which we have packaged into: 

querytype.txt : the original query packet
querytype.crc.txt : the query packet with an appended CRC
querytype.crcerr.txt : the query packet with an appended incorrect crc. 

The packets we wish to test: 
1. arp query
2. icmp-echo

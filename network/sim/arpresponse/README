We connect the inputcontrol to the arpquery interface and pass in
three arp packets:

1. a correct arp who-has? which is targeted at us
2. a correct arp who-has? which isn't targeted at us


We use a framework of "transmitted packet", "verify packet" to make
sure our output is as expected.

The input packet is just a list of input 16-bit words, as is the output packet.

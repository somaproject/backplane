This is used to verify a sequence of output events. 

On the falling edge of RESET we open the file EVENTFILE and read in
all of its events into an internal buffer; each event implicitly is
associated with a position in this buffer.

Then, we compare the ouput events from the eventport with the events
in the buffer. If, ahead of time, an event is marked via the INVCLK
interface as invalid, then it is not compared and in fact skipped over
in the buffer.

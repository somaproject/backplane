We have two prototype retx packets, pkt1.txt and pkt2.txt, with their
associated sequence / id properties.

We feed these to the inputcontrol, and then verify both the dataretx
modules' requests of the retxbuffer, and the generated output.

The third requests results in the retxbuffer-level returning the wrong seq id, and thus verifies proper assertion of the PKTNOTINBUF error counter.

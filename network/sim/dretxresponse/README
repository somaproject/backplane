Here we generate some retx request packets and attempt to verify they
are requesting the right values, and that we ultimately output the
correct packets.

1. generate fake packets, sending to port 4400, along with a file containing their metadata. 

TYP SRC ID for each packet

2. the data is captured via tcpdump
 tcpdump -p src host 192.168.0.2 and  udp -t -xx -s 2000 > data.tcpdump


and stored in data.tcpdump

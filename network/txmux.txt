The TX input mux selects among armed inputs. To send a packet, a
device asserts the ARM signal and waits for the assertion of GRANT.

Note that ARM should be deasserted by the source once GRANT has been
asserted to prevent multiple-triggering.


When GRANT is asserted, that port is given the exclusive control of the output to the NIC. 

The DEN and and DIN are passed through after a register phrase. 

When DENMUX transitions from high-to-low, that port has completed
sending its packet. Then, we deassert ARM and move on. 

Prioritization: 

In an attempt to prioritize TX traffic, we engage in the following: 

Every cycle we query all ports 0 to N to see if they are ready to TX. 

port              we tx
0  1  2  3  4  5
T  x  x  x  x  x  0 
0  T  x  x  x  x  1

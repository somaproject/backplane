The test items we wish to cover are: 

packet length
latency
arp cache hit/miss (and resulting request)
broadcast or not


There are two resulting data files:


control.dat  frames.dat

control.dat contains the above information

arppending, packet length (int), proto (int), latency (int), arp hit, mac response (48 bits),  srcmac(48b hex), subnet(32b hex), srcip(32b hex), destip(32b hex)

The IPs are stored as 32-bit numbers; we use IPN to extract out the relevant bits . Note that packet length is THE LENGTH OF THE IP PACKET IN BYTES.

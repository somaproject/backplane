TX CRC: append an ethernet CRC to the transmitted frame and increase the packet lenght. 

We do this by latching the frame len, adding four, and transmitting
that, as well as appending the CRC properly.

note that we must be able to perform all of this in < 4 additional cycles so we do not back up the TX.

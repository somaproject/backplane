\section{Event Transmission}

The event transmitter is somewhat complex due to the desire to avoid
sending packets with no / few events, but to also avoid event
overflow. A worst-case would be every single event in an event cycle
being directed at the network device; This would result in 960 bytes
of data for the UDP packet. But sending a single event wastes 80% of
the ethernet frame capacity. But we also wish to avoid prolonged
periods of event queuing.

To meet these parameters, we send an event datagram whenever: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item More than 5 ecycles have passed without a transmission
\item There is not enough empty space in the current packet to send the current ecycle. 
\end{enumerate}

At 50 MHz, a 1024-byte event takes 10.3 $\mu s$ to transmit. We need to
maintain the ability for the network TX interface to transmit one of
these per cycle.

Our implementation uses separatemodules to write the relevant bits for
the IP/UDP headers and the data. 

Each module writes into an EventTx Output FIFO, which is a 4-deep fifo
with the relevant bits of an event UDP datagram as constants (such as
protocol number).

We use two of these fifos, one for eventual output to the network
interface, and one for output to the retransmission buffer. The two
distinct outputs allow for the different interfaces to receive data at
different rates.

Note our interface depends quite heavily on the implicit timing from
the event bus. In particular, upon assertion of an ECYCLE, we wait ~5
ticks until we have counted the number of events in this cycle. Then,
if this will ``break the bank'' we must commit the current buffer
\textit{and} reset all relevant logic before the Event Body Writer
begins writing the current event's packets.


\subsection{Event Body Writer}

\end{figure}

The eventbodywriter receives events via an Event Port and: 

1. writes the event data from byte 1 ... 12*N - 1
2. after the events are done, writes the number-of-events-written to byte 0
3. then asserts done. 

We are guaranteed at least 40 ticks between the assertion of ECYCLE
and the first assertion of WEOUT for that cycle. 

At the assertion of DONE, we verify/guarantee that ADDR contains the
address of the word that is one-past the last written word. For
example, if we wrote one event, then the len was written at addr 0,
the event was in 1-12, and ADDR will equal 13 when DONE is asserted,
and stay at that for 40 ticks.

\subsection{Event Header Writer}
The event header writer writes all the unique per-packet data including: 
IP addr
MAC addr
packet length
UDP packet length
frame length

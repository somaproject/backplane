\section{Input Control}

The input control interface acquires an inbound frame from the Network
Interface and stores it in an internal buffer. A FSM determines
whether the inbound packet is for the device (destination IP address
matches) and if it is: 

\begin{itemize}
\item An inbound event packet
\item An inbound event retransmission request
\item An inbound data retransmission request
\item An ARP who-has query directed at us
\item An ICMP Echo request (ping) packet. 
\end{itemize}

It then triggers the correct packet transmission module and provides
that module exclusive access to its internal buffer.


\subsection{Interface}
To acquire a frame from the NIC \signal{NEXTFRAME} is asserted.  The
data is valid during the assertion of \signal{DOEN}. The first word
transmitted will be the packet length in bytes. We need to wait until
we have received that amount of data before deasserting
\signal{NEXTFRAME} and interacting with the packet.

The assertion of, for example, \signal{PINGSTART} tells the ICMP Echo
Reply processing module that the frame stored within should be
processed. \signal{PINGADDR[9:0]} now can access any of the 2048
stored words, which appear on \signal{PKTDATA[15:0]} one cycle later
(the standard BlockRAM latency). The processing module asserts
\signal{PINGDONE} to indicate that it has finished its processing,
allowing the acquisition of another inbound frame.

The operation of the other \signal{RETXSTART}, \signal{ARPSTART}, and
\signal{EVENTSTART} interfaces are analogous.

\subsection{Implementation} 

We use a dual-ported BlockRAM as a packet storage buffer, and read in
the frame into the buffer. The FSM then examines the contents of the
frame by setting \signal{INTADDRB} to various values and decoding the
results.

We validate the inbound CRC-32 checksum using the CRC-Verify module,
and also modify the length to be four less than the received length
value, effectively deleting the terminal CRC. 

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{ARP Query} : The FSM checks Ethernet Protocol type and
  ARP query type.
\item \textbf{ICMP Echo Request}: The FSM checks Ethernet Protocol
  type, IP protocol type, and ``ICMP meaning'' fields.
\item \textbf{Data Retransmission Request} : The FSM checks Ethernet
  Protocol type, IP protocol type, and port number.
\item \textbf{Event Retransmission Request} : The FSM checks Ethernet
  Protocol type, IP protocol type, and port number.
\item \textbf{Inbound events} : The FSM checks Ethernet Protocol type,
  IP protocol type, and port number.
\end{itemize}

Packet analysis begins in \signal{NONE}, and terminates in the
\signal{NEXTPKT} state, the latter repeated in Figure
\ref{inputcontrol.fsm} for clarity.

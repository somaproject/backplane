Concerns about the rapid expansion of the ping (ICMP Echo-Request /
Response) FSM and the number of counters present in the design
motivated the separation of IP-header-writing and ICMP-body-writing
components :


PINGIPwriter: Writes ethernet frame headers and MAC headers

PINGICMPwriter: writes all of ICMP body data, using the length
acquired from the IP frame

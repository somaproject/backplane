The network interface is somewhat difficult as we want to be
low-latency, high bandwidth, enable retransmission of lost datagrams,
and we also want to be easy to implement in hardware.

Our target functions are: 

Transmit: 
1. variable-length data bus UDP datagrams
2. fixed-length event bus UDP datagrams
3. arp responses
4. ICMP-echo responses
5. retransmit-request responses

Receive: 
1. event datagrams
2. arp queries
3. icmp queries
4. retransmission requests

We severely limit the type of network our system operates on to being
a single subnet ideally behind some sort of firewall, running with a
subnet mask of 255.255.255.0. The Soma Backplane can only send traffic
on this subnet, as there are no provisions for routing or packet
fragmentation.

What do we want our syscontrol interface to do: 

1. boot all bootserperipheral-like devices, such as NIC, ADIO,
   display, etc.

2. For some of these devices, we'll need to do ``some stuff'' to get
   them into boot-ing order

3. there is other out-of-band stuff we need to do to boot

It's not quite clear how the configuration and setup are supposed to
work, except that this might get pretty complex pretty quickly. For
any given device:


--------------------------------------------
For the NIC only
--------------------------------------------

0. Set BootSerPer mask 
1. toggle FPROG
2. acquire the File Handle
3. send the filename
4. Open the file
5. Until the read bytes > filelen:
   
   a. read the next 512 bytes (64 packets)
   b. for each inbound data packet: 
      write to BootSerPeripheral
      increment word counter
      increment packet counter
   c. done
6. send any post-events

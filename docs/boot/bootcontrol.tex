The boot control interface serves as the bridge between the output of
the rx event fifo and the mmcfpgaboot interface, handling command
recept and response.

Boot Is the simple low-level interface to the MMC-based early-stage
boot configuration for all devices. 

It receives a single command, 0x20, which is structured as follows: 

word 0: high bits of field mask
word 1: low bits of field mask

word 2: length (in 512-byte blocks) of boot sequence
word 3: address to start to boot from

it sends one response back to the original sender


0x20: Response, with : 
   byte 0: 0x0002 -- boot complete and successful
	   0x0001 -- boot request ignored, current boot pending


           The interface of bootcontrol is such that the first boot
           request it receives places it in ``booting'' mode
           (\signal{BOOTING} = 1) and all subsequent requests cause an
           error response until the boot is complete.

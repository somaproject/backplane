Boot Is the simple low-level interface to the MMC-based early-stage
boot configuration for all devices. 

It receives a single command, 0x20, which is structured as follows: 

byte 0-1: bit mask indiciating which devices to boot
byte 2: length (in 512-byte blocks) of boot sequence
bytes 3: address to start to boot from

it sends one response back to the original sender


0x20: Response, with : 
   byte 0: 0x0002 -- boot complete and successful
	   0x0001 -- boot request ignored, current boot pending

The soma backplane core handles the routing of event and data packets along the event and data buses. 

The protocols involved are closely linked with the soma RX and TX protocols. In particular, event and data broadcast are handled here. 

The core itself runs at TXBYTECLK, except for the portion which
handles the data packets. 



EPOS:
0 :  beginning of event cycle 
1 :  DGRANTA
2 :  EADDRA[0]
6 :  EADDRA[4]
7 :  DGRANTA
8 :  EADDRA[0]
12 : EADDRA[4]
13 : EDATA [sequential, as expected]

Routing core... We try hard to avoid putting any child instances into the event core, and keeping it relatively event-device-position-agnostic.

Event Receiver
--------------------------------------------------------

The event receiver performs event locking and partitioning every
ECYCLE, as well as clock domain transitions between RXBYTECLK and
TXBYTECLK.


---------------------------------------------------------
Data receiver
---------------------------------------------------------

The data receiver handles the passing of the data tokens between 
client devices;

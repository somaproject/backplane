\section{Data Port Interface}

The data port interface is exceptionally simple. A device on a DataBus
Port samples its DGRANT line when ECYCLE is high; this determines
whether or not that port can send data during the next event cycle.

Data is gated into the DataBus Aggregator by the DOEN line; a new data
packet is read in during the assertion of DOEN. Further DOEN
assertions will have no effect. Likewise, assertion of DOEn by a port
that was not granted will also result in a no-op. 

\section{Implementation}

Our implementation here is somewhat complex, as we'd like the ability
to multiplex multiple streams and handle multiple dgrants
simultaneoulsy. Thus our implementation is a 1:N aggregator, and we
can wire up M of them; to cover all 64 devicelink devices, we'd need 4
1:8 muxes, etc.

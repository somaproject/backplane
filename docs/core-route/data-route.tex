\section{Data Port Interface}

The data port interface is exceptionally simple. A device on a DataBus
Port samples its DGRANT line when ECYCLE is high, and keeps it high
throughout the ECYCLE; this determines whether or not that port can
send data during the next event cycle.

Data is gated into the DataBus Aggregator by the DOEN line; a new data
packet is read in during the assertion of DOEN. Further DOEN
assertions will have no effect. Likewise, assertion of DOEn by a port
that was not granted will also result in a no-op. 

\section{Implementation}

Since each DeviceMux can only output one of its 4 devices, we will
need to mux 64/4 = 16 possible inputs; since our network stack can
take in two inputs, we need 2 8:1 muxes.

We cycle drants sequentially within a devicemux;

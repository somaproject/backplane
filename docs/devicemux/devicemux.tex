The devicemux implements layer 2-3 operation for the soma backplane to
interface the devicelink with the soma core Event Port and Data Port. 

The devicemux turns the devicelink into a quad-device link; in the
future this could be increased to 4.

We implement the indicated devicelink protocol, and serve as an
interface between the ports and the link itself. This also detects the
link-down situation and properly ignores all non-active link activity.

\subsection{DeviceMux TX}
The default transmit byte for TXDOUT is 0xBC. An ECYCLE drives
\signal{TXKOUT} which then sends a ``K28.5'' comma word to indicate
the start of an event packet. The subsequent word sees the
transmission of the relevant headers. We simply use a FSM to govern
which of the 4 device headers we're sending, walking through them via
the \signal{HEADERPOS} counter.

Once we have sent the headers, we then just passively let the data stream through. After all of it has sent, we transisiton back to NONE and wait for the next ECYCLE. 

\subsection{DeviceMux RX}

The deviceMUX rx module handles incoming data bursts and

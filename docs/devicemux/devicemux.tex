The devicemux implements layer 2-3 operation for the soma backplane to
interface the devicelink with the soma core Event Port and Data Port. 

The devicemux turns the devicelink into a dual-device link; in the
future this could be increased to 4.

We implement the indicated devicelink protocol, and serve as an
interface between the ports and the link itself. This also detects the
link-down situation and properly ignores all non-active link activity.

This keeps a record of the number and lenght of packets we have
transmitted.

The overarching goal was to be as small and fast as possible as we
continue to run low on slices in our core FPGA. 

PKTLENEN latches the current length for the current tx buffer into the
register file.

The mapping is
OSEL[i] = TXCHAN[0] length
OSEL[i + 8] = TXCHAN[0] count

If a RSTCNT is triggered during the writing of any channel, that
channel's update will fail and the reset will succeed. This might mean
that we end up with inconsistent / not 100% accurate counts, but hey,
they're counters, not mission-critical infrastructure. As it stands
this should be more than good enough for debugging purposes.

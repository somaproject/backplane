what do we need to do to read in counter? remember we just get 12 ticks

load src address
load cnt address
or with higher-bits
load value
load value
load value
output src
output addr
output word1
output word2
output word3
output cmd

Every three reads of a particular address cycles through all the words
in the mux. Yes, this is a hack, but it's a robust one. 

Also, every three reads with the correct OADDR will reset the mux cntr
to 0.

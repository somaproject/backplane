NetControl handles: 
   Network stack counters
   Ethernet Interface and link management
   IP settings


How much status monitoring / etc. should there be? 

Every N cycles we read the link and check to see if the cable
is still attached? 

0x30: raw access to the NIC Control interface
0x31: bring up the interface:
    causes a nic reset
    and then any site-specific nic settings
    and then possibly a dump of any of the mac/phy settings to the nic? 

And then the status events are : 
0x32: Link status (up/down)


------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Counters : 
------------------------------------------------------------------------

these are all 48-bit counters that contain packet counts, with: 
CMDCNTQUERY: 0x40
DATA[0] = addr of the thing we're querying
response: CMD 0x40
DATA[0] = addr of counter
DATA[1] = cntr[47:32]
data[2] = cntr[31:16]
data[3] = cntr[15:0]




------------------------------------------------------------------------
Network Settings
------------------------------------------------------------------------

CMDNETWRITE : 0x42
from any address, DATA[0] says what we write:
    DATA[0] = 0x0001 : DATA[2:3] is IP address
    DATA[0] = 0x0002 : DATA[2:3] is IP bcast address
    DATA[0] = 0x0003 : DATA[2:4] is MAC address

CMDNETQUERY : 0x43

queries the current value, with DATA[0] being the requested word,
returned as above.

both of these respond with CMDNETRESPONSE, with Data[0] indicating
the word and the relevant bits as above. 

Counter read addresses / positions

0: 0x12345678 // verification
1: RXIOCRCERR count
2. RX packet count

8 : TX0LEN (byte length of TX Port 0)
...
15 : TX7LEN (byte length of TX port 7)
16 : TX0CNT (packet count of TX port 0)
...
23 : TX7CNT (packet count)


\subsection{Implementation}

Primary state: STATE_NONE and STATE_RAISELINK

LINK_ are the substates in netcontrol

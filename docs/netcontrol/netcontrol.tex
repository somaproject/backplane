NetControl handles all layer 3 and above control and status
information. At the moment this includes IP-settings and various
network status counters.

CMD A: from any address, DATA[0] says what we write:
    DATA[0] = 0x0001 : DATA[2:3] is IP address
    DATA[0] = 0x0002 : DATA[2:3] is IP bcast address
    DATA[0] = 0x0003 : DATA[2:4] is MAC address

pending any of these, we broadcast the updated data to all parties. 

Network Counters:

these are all 32-bit counters that contain packet counts, with: 
CMDA : reset (with associated bitfield)
CMDB : query DATA[0] = requested register
   gets a response with 
   CMDB: DATA[0] = register

   also, we periodically broadcast to everyone the register values,
   say every 100 us.

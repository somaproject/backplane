We can view event command words as essentially being two-byte ID. 

Thus, we partition the event space into a series of commands that everyone might want to send. 




Scenario:

1. Updated tetrode settings: 
    To: everyone 
    From: DSPboards
    CMD : 

2. RESET
    To: everyone / anyone
    from: anyone
    CMD:

3. Set your gain to foo:
    To: DSPboards
    from: anyone
    CMD:


So, we can divide our event classes into the following criteria:


Sender: one, subset, any
Receiver: one : all

Who are the senders:
NEP
USB
Ether
DIO
LCD/UI
Timer
Network
Tetrode DSPs (32) 

Sender is the same as the receiver / EVENTID

Thus DSPs are lower 32, etc. 

Event 0x00: null event, i..e NOP. MUST BE NO-OP FOR EVERYONE!

Events 0x1-0x1F : "broadcast" events, i.e. events that can be sent by anyone
to everyone

broadcast events, sender independent:
0x01: Change device into boot mode, if it exists. dw0[0] = boot mode
0x02: state of reset, dw[0] = reset mode (1 == reset)
0x03: boot memory configure. dw0 = addr of first word
		  d1 = first 16-bit word to write
		  d4 = last 16-bit word to write
0x04: timing update
		       to reset the timer.	  
		       dw0[0] = 1 == reset the timer
		       dw2  == high word of current time
		       dw3  == low word of current time

Broadcast events, sender dependent:
   these are generally events where the device sending them will send them to all devices, but are specific to the device sending them. I.e. network says "my link is down". 

0x20-0x2F
0x20: systemic state change:
       Ethernet down
       link changed
       device successfully booted
0x21: application specific
      tetrode gain change

unicast events, from specific sender to specific receiver, stereotyped thoug. These are common ones. 
0x30-0x3F :
0x30 : Error. Event that is sent replying to a specific device saying "I just got an invalid event from you." Error events are sent to a specific individual, and are generally encoded as:




Events 0x40-0x4F : system configuration events for a particular device
These are events that are device specific, and where the sender 


Events 0x80-0xFF: userspace? : )

Boot Is the simple low-level interface to the MMC-based early-stage
boot configuration for all devices. 

It receives a single command, 0x20, which is structured as follows: 

word 0-1: bit mask indiciating which devices to boot
word 2: length (in 512-byte blocks) of boot sequence
word 3: address to start to boot from

it sends one response back to the original sender


0x20: Response, with : 
   byte 0: 0x0002 -- boot complete and successful
	   0x0001 -- boot request ignored, current boot pending



Boot file organization: 

Every MB we have a new ROM

ADDR (in 512-byte blocks) :    Block len:
0x0000                         0x0780 (don't worry) 
0x0800			       0x006c (0x001)

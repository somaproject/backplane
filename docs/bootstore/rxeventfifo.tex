The rxeventfifo is designed to interface with a core event port and
provide a simple synchronous input FIFO for event reception, handling
event address decoding. 

The biggest challenge in the fifo is getting the timing correct. We
already suffer from a proliferation of counters for keeping track of
fifo state, and we really didn't want to add too many more.

Every inbound event, nay every inbound byte, is actually written to
the fifo, but on the 12th byte (BCNT = 11) if that EATX bit is set we
increment the MSBs of the fifo input address (EINCNT), essentially
``saving'' this event.

Readout is simple: the assertion of EVALID informs the client that the
event readable by EOUTA / EOUTD is valid; when the client is done
reading that event, they can assert \signal{ENEXT}, and then on the
subsequent cycle test EVALID again.

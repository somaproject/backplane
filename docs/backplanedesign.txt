Notes on backplane design:

Power concerns:

All the SFX PSUs output ~16 A max on the 3.3V rail, which should be more than enough for the 16 DSP boards. However:
1. The combined power from the 3.3 and 5V rails leaves us with only around 1A at 5V, not enough to power the rest of the 3.3V subsystem with LDOs. 
2. The bulk of the extra power in higher-power units is delivered to the 12V rail, and the only way we're going to tap into this without turning the box into a furnace is to use a switching regulator. 

Okay, so most of the cool TI power regulators that are easy to use also have horrible horrible input voltage maximums, like 5V. Yea, right. So we're using the TPS54356, along with their SWIFT designer tool. It recommends the following parts:


Inductor: 22 uH CDRH127-220 (308-1081-1-ND $3.05)
Mosfet : ZXM64N02X (ZXM64N02XCT-ND $2.39)
Output Cap: TPSD107M010R0100 100uF, 10V, 100 mOhm (478-1779-1-ND, $2.35)
Input Bulk Cap: EEVFK1C152Q, 1500uF (PCE3459CT-ND, $1.416)
Input Bypass Cap: C3225X5R1C106M (445-1400-1-ND, $2.20)

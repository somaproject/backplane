The soma backplane communicates with external devices via the Soma
DeviceLink interface.

The DeviceLink interface is a full-duplex high-speed serial connect
capable of transporting arbitrary byte streams and selected control
characters at 30 MB/sec in both directions. Links are labeled TX and
RX from the perspective of the Soma Core. The DeviceLink is
source-synchronous from the core, guaranteeing one symbol per clock
tick for both core and device.

The DeviceLink allows for two device nodes and arbitrary data packets
according to the DeviceLink Protocol.

Eric,

Listed below is a link for my "standard" stackups.  If you are trying to control your impedence, my suggestion would be to come up with a stackup that will allow for what you are trying to achieve, include this in your gerber files and select controlled dieletric on your quote.  That way it is built the way you want.

If you need anything else, please let me know.

Subject: Layer stack thickness?


Linda, I have another question if you don't mind: What's the layer
stack thickness for your standard 6-layer PCB stack? I'm trying to do
some impedance-controlled layout, and what I really care about is the
consistency of the laminate thickness between layer 1 (top) and layer
2. Other vendors are saying this might vary between 4 and 8 mils,
which can change my calculations by up to 100%! What's the variance
for your thickness numbers?

Thanks,
		...Eric Jonas

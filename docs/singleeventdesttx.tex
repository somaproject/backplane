\section{Single Event Destination TX}

Sometimes you want a simple way of sending an event to a single
destination. No broadcast and no real queueing. 

That's where this module comes in. Build up your event using the
address/data/write-enable lines, assert \signal{ESEND}, and then just
sit back and wait for the \signal{EPENDING} to be deasserted.

Note that \signa{EDEST[6:0]} is latched on the assertion of
\signal{ESEND}.

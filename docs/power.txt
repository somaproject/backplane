Backplane power design and considerations

We are using a conventional ATX power supply, which provides: 
5V
3.3V
12V

Estimated power consumption is as follows. For our purposes we assume that all devices use a negligable amount of power on the 5V rail, and thus everything is at 3.3V

DSP Board: if each BF is ~0.5W and the RAM is 0.2W and then the FPGA
is 0.5W we're looking at 4*.7 + 0.5 = 3.5W per DSP board, or ~56W
total, which at 3.3V is ~16 A. 


There exist lots of external, ~100W supplies out there if you know
where to look. TR100 Switching supply, model TR100A120, 12V @ 8.33A.
in stock at mouser We can safely assume we're not pulling in 20 W
through a connector, so we'll need to generate 3.3V, 5V, 1.2V, 2.8V,
and 1.8V.

For this supply it claims we can pick between a 2.1mm and 2.5mm plug, and there are distinct part numbers for each. At the moment mouser appears to ahve the 2.5mm one in stock, so we go with it! Mouser part 418-TR100A120-02. 

We're going to use SC1048-ND or SC1050-ND for power panel jacks, and just have the assembly house build up a custom cable. 



We've  selected  TI's  new  T2  generation  of  point-of-load  voltage
regulators.  PTH08T220W  and  PTH08T240W  have identical  pinouts  and
accept  wide input  voltage  ranges,  with the  former  being the  16A
version and the latter 10A.

The EBS (-WAH) component is the through-hole one. 

Additionally we could look at the PTH12010W (EUH is through-hole, EUJ is smd)


For each of the above, we're going to identify the possible capacitor values: 

PTH08T240W: 

Input: At least 220 uF input electrolytic, with 700 mArms ripple for Vo < 3 and and 240 mArms for Vo > 3.0 V. Must have < 100mOhm ESR. Also 22 uF X5R/X7R for input. 

Output: at least 220 uF for output of al, poly-al, or tantalum. More specifics are determined by TurboTrans requirements. 

PTH12010W:

INput: at least 560 uF / 800 mArms. Optional 10 uF X5R/X7R.  ESR < 100 mOhm. 

Output: 330 uF aluminum electrolytic, ESR > 4 mOhm

PTH08T220W: 

INput: at least 330 uF / 950 mA RMS. (1500 mArms when Vo > 2.0 and Io > 11A). ESR < 100 mOhm. 

Output: 220 uF al alectorlytic, optional 10uF ceramic. 

 
Possible capacitors: 

APXA160ARA331MJC0G 330 uF, 14 mOhm ESR,  5050 mArms ripple, 16V. NPcap-PXA series. JCO size. Could use 2. 




Now, the decision: because digikey has Multiple Vendors for the
PTH12010WA we're going with it. Sorry, TI, your sexy little tiny ones
are cute and all, but multi-vendor sourcing trumps all. The SMD versions are available from many sources. 

PTH12010W:

Input: at least 560 uF / 800 mArms. Optional 10 uF X5R/X7R.  ESR < 100 mOhm. 

EEV-FK1V681Q: 680 uF / 35 V / 1100 mA rms, ESR ~ 60 mOhm. H13
EEE-FK1v331P: 330 uF / 35 V / 880 mA rms / 80 mOhm ESR. Size G. 

Output: 330 uF aluminum electrolytic, ESR > 4 mOhm. Also works here. 

We plan to use 3 of these on our board: 

Primary VCC: 
Power First 8 DSP boards, NIC, core BGA. 3.3V 
Secondary VCC: Powers second 8 DSP boards, non-core Devices. 3.3V 
5V: Total overkill supply of 5V power. 

Other power we'll care abot: 
2.5V : ~0.5 A for LVDS IO. 
1.8V : ~1 A for DDR RAM
1.2V: ~ 2.5A A for FPGA core

Because we need > 1.5 A for 1.2V core, we're going to use the same
1.2V regulator module we're using on the DSPboards. Even though the
PTH03000W is not a POLA device, all of the similar-spec POLA devices
suffer from poor availability.

I can't find any documentation for the xilinx/SSTL18 Vref docs in
terms of power consumption, so I'm going to assume ~100 mA and get an
appropriately-sized LDO. We're using the TPS76201 SOT-3 100mA part which
has wide availability and can generate the low 0.9 V voltage needed.

 
Hi Eric, The reason PCBexpress is so wide open is that at one time they
were dialed real tight, and a customer returned the boards for being 1/2
mil outside a listed range.  So we (PCBexpress and PCBpro)learned to
give a range we would never be outside of.

PCBpro and PCBexpress uses the same construction sheet listed as number
1 below.  PCBpro has other standard thicknesses that PCBexpress does
not, listed numbers 2-3 below. 

Let me give you the amount of prepeg we use for our PCBpro selections
between layer 1/top and next layer down ( L2). ( #1 is PCBexpress
choice)
1) A .062" order has 1 sheet of 2116 and 1 sheet of 1080 that together
measures .007"
2) A .093" order has 3 sheets of 1080 that measure .0075"
3) A .125" order has 1 sheet 7628 and 2 sheets 1080 that together
measures .012"


Some reasoning: Depending on wither your designs second layer is copper
plane, or traces will affect the prepeg's final measurement( PCBexpress
has the 8mil to give it an extra 1 mil for plane layers, and 4 to give
it an extra 1 mil for signal layers). The prepegs +/-  tolerance is a
small margin but could be a reason the measurement on a plane layer
would be more than the given measurement.

During press the materials compress and the second layers copper will be
pushed into the Prepeg at different rates depending on that geometry.
If the second layer is a signal trace layer the 1 oz copper height of
the  traces ( .0012") push into the given prepeg's thickness and reduce
the measurement below the given thickness ( no less than 4 mil).  If the
second layer is plane, it will be close to the given and we add some (
no more than 8 mil).  IF the second layer is both traces, and
plane........somewhere between 4-8 mils.

PCBpro can also tailor special constructions using standard on hand
materials for its design review orders ( as thin as .005" between
layers) when thicknesses are provided in a print. These are reviewed on
a case by case basis, and we would still need to have a tolerance range
to account for geometry of the layers given to us.		

Hope this helps, Sincerely,

Subject: Board stack thickness, variability?

Hello! PCBexpress claims their layer stack-up for a 6-layer board has
the fr-4 between copper layers 1 and 2 being between 4 and 8 mils thick.
What is the thickness of your standard 6-layer process, and does it vary
by that much? 

My problem is that, to get my differential impedance correct, I need to
know the ground-plane-to-trace distance pretty accurately. A factor of 2
difference turns my 100-ohm trace pair into a 60-ohm trace pair. 

I'm not too picky about the final number, just that it has a low
variance. Thanks for all the help,
			...Eric

The ethernet interface is the general control interface for the
MAC/PHY on the NIC.

To that extent, things we care about are:
1. maintaining link status
2. providing a debug interface to the registers on the PHY
3. Generic PHY interfacing

Events: 
1. low-level things
2. set MAC address
3. 


Simple command : 

Word 0: CMD | SRC
Word 1: 0 = R, 1 = W
Word 2: Addr [LSBs] 
Words 3-4: 32-bit input word

and the response will contain the nic response

The current implementation is really targeted at only responding to a
single event and doing so in a very simplistic fashion. We don't
really know exactly what we want this module to do, nor the extent of
initialization that is necessary to bring up the ethernet interface.

This is our third attempt to organize this design. 

This is not an easy task. 

Event buses and data buses: The basics

What is an event
what is data? 

How we organize -- internally and externally

Top-down:

Event IDs, buses, etc

The event port, the data port


Then, to communicate with devices: 



So, I like the idea of organizing as follows:

Chapter 1: The backplane
  Function 

Chapter 2: The event bus
  event organization 

Chapter 3: The data bus

Chapter 4: The deviceLink -- only protocol definition
  section 1: Overview
  section 2: network layer
  section 3: link layer
     lock protocol? 
  section 4: Physical layer

Chapter 5: The network Protocols

Chapter 5.5 : Core: Routing 
Chapter 6: Core: devicelink implementation


Chapter 7: Device Devicelink IMplementation

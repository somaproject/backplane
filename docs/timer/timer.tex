The timer module occupies a special privledged position on the Event Bus, being responsible for emiting the EVENT signals that condition event timing for the entire system. 

It is an exceedingly simple device, emitting the system timestamp every event.

The system timestamp is a 48-bit unsigned integer that is present in
the first three words of an event, with the MSB in the first word. The
event is always broadcast to all clients.

This event is broadcast to all devices.

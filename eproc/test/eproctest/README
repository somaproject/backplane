EPROCTEST: how large is an EventProc? How fast can it run in an S-3? 

We connect an internal block ram as our Instruction RAM
and we heavily register the inputs to the FORCE IO. 

CLKIN: 50 MHz, which we turn into : 
   CLK: 50 MHz
   CLKHI : 100 MHz

 We fake an event input by having a
generic encoder/decoder pair for EARX and EATX

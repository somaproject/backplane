The EventProc is a general-purpose event processor designed to run at
50 MIPS/100 MHz and be synthesizable in a spartan-3. It was designed
to simplify some of the more complex state-control logic present when
trying to operate on the event bus, and is loosly modeled off of the
Xilinx PicoBlaze series of constant programmable state machines.

A DSL has been created in python to aid in the programming of the
device. Up to 16 hardware-accelerated event-processing handlers can be
installed, each with a range of acceptable cmds and srcs to respond
to.

The "EProc" design consists of an ecore, the core processor element
which can be tested and used independently.

TODO:
ecore: test the other jumps
ecore: implement INPORT instructions
ecore: is this the final state of the ALU? 
ecore: document instruction menumonics
assemble: other ALU ops? 
assemble: specialized event-based ALU ops? 
eproc: verify that the event tx stuff

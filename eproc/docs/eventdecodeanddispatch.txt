Event Decode and Dispach: Hardware-accelerated predicate evaluation
and dispatch address look-up.

After we assert \signal{START}, \signal{CMD[7:0]} and
\signal{SRC[7:0]}.

Predicates are of the form:

if CMD <= CMDLE and CMD >= CMDGE and SRC <= SRCLE and SRC >= SRCGE then
   jump to address

If a predicate matches, MATCH is high upon DONE assertion, and the
ADDR[9:0] is the target jump. 


To write the predicates: 
TGTADDR[1:0] = 00 :  TGTADDR
               01 :  CMDLE & CMDGE 
	       10 :  SRCLE & SRCGE
TGTADDR[5:2] = the address

From the assertion of start it takes 17 ticks to render a verdict


-----------------------------------
implementation

WE just use a few register files, and once START is asserted we just
sequence through all ADDRs.

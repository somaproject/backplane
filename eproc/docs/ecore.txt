EPROCCORE: the core processor, which has the following signals: 

CLK: 100 MHz clock
CPHASE: which CPU cycle the processor is in (FIXME: input or output?)
-- instruction interface: 
IADDR[9:0] : synchronous instruction memory address
IDATA[17:0] : synchronous instruction memory data
-- io ports
IPORTADDR[7:0] : input port address
IPORTDATA[15:0] : input port data
IPORTSTROBE

OPORTADDR[7:0]
OPORTDATA[15:0]
OPORTSTROBE

-- interrupt / interface ports
FORCEJUMP: force the ops to a particular address
FORCEADDR[9:0] : forced address

-- event interface
EADDR[2:0]
EDATA[15:0]
  (non-synchronous!!)
For our double-buffered interface to the current set of events.

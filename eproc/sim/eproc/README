A test of the entire eproc architecture. Rock on! 

We send a series of events periodically:
   * Most-recent-state: once per ecycle, we send an event
     from src 0, cmd 0, with a continually-increasing counter in dataword[0]
     We store this counter in running CountVal

   * 0x10 <= ecmd <= 0x20: "increment" events, consisting of a 
     series of numbers in the datawords. if SRC < 40, we 
     add Dataword[0] to running total0, otherwise we 
     add Dataword[4] to running total1. 
   * to-reply events: 
     any cmd = 0x80, we echo back to the source all the datawords
  
Every ECYCLE:
   0. we output 0xABCD at addr 0x00
   1. we output CountVal at 0x01
   2. we output total0 at addr 0x00
   3. we output total1 at addr 0x01

"Basic load" -- the most basic ECORE CPU test possible. 


We simply load each register with an immediate value, and then write
each immediate value to the output port in increasing order, and
verify that the output port values are correct.


basicload.py: generates program.iram, the instruction ram values
that we run

outport.verify.dat: the output port values, in the relevant order

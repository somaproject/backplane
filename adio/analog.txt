Analog component identification. 


I no longer feel that we can rely on AD to use distributors which
allow low-quantity purchases, whereas LT and TI seem to do so quite
happily.

For Analog out and in, assuming one event per ecycle, we have ~500 kB
of bandwidth, which works out to 250 kSPS of 16-bit words.


Requirements identification: 

DAC: 
  12-16 bits, 8 channel, output buffers that we can tristate, ideally internal reference. ~200 ksps total, but flexible. 

DAC8554 from TI: New part, quad-channel, 16TSSOP, has pin-compat siblings, available from avnet, digikey, mouser. 

ADC: 
  12-16 Bits, 8 channels, at least 0-5V range. On one hand, I'd love for this to be bipolar, but the power requirements

The LTC1857/8/9 series looks ideal for our ADC, with a SPI interface,
althoug at 100 kHz it's a bit slow. The variable input ranges are nice
though. One thought is that we'd rather interface with esoteric
voltages than have a fast converter. If ultimately we just end up
being able to do 12.5 kHz/chan, oh well. Or they could pick two
channels and do 100 kSPS.




Power configuration: We can't really do bipolar without involving some
sort of inverting converter, and it's not compelling enough to really
do that. but we can deliver 12 V of stepping power and then use an LDO to step that down to 10 V, and use that. 

ADC input amps:

We'll use the LTC6242

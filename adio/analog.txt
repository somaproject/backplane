Our new design calls for being able to tristate the output of the DACs. Now, 0-5V at 14 bit gives an LSB of 300 uV. We're using the AD5392BST-5. 


This is unfortunate, because the RON flatness of the ADG802 at 5V in normal temp ranges is 0.05 ohm, meaning that if the target is sinking 10 mA, we see a voltage difference of potentially 500 uV. So we're essentially losing our LSB in INL (?). 

In any case, these muxes are needed because they are by far the superior solution.  

The ADC needs a 2.5V reference, but the DACs have internal references.

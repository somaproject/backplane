16 DACs (12 bit, 100 ksps max)
16 ADCs?
64 digital out
   output patterns, 
64 digital in

fiber tranceiver

Have a "generic IO" board ala network board? 

Problems: cost ($150 for board)

Hmmm....
this is ass...

Ideally, we have our UI board and our general IO board, well, the same PCB, except that the UI board needs to be soldered to the front of the PCB...
wait, why? Why not have a wimpy little daughter board? 

Use ADSP-21262? What do we want? 


Digital Ouput:
Patterns
  write frequency multiple, bitmask 
  write triggering event
individual bit flipping
time-related flipping (i.e. toggle low-high every n clock ticks)

digital input: 
  fire event foo when inputs match pattern bar
  interrupts (low-> high, high->low)

For both digital and analog: the criticism could be made that we should just use a larger FPGA with more IO. While this is true, we'd still need to do line-level conversion, which would necessitate the same number of 8-bit ICs. (8 total). So we may just as well bite the bullet and do serial stuff, and use an FPGA where we already know dimensions, etc. 


analog output:
   arbitrary value, i.e. buffering the output
   triggerable, n-sample memories
   TLV5630 really looks like best part, but the 
   AD5383 is pretty sweet too (32 chan 12 bit) [ oh, but really expensive!]

   if you really care about analog whatever, use the fiber interface outputs....

   we can have an internal 16-bit set of converters on the tiny 2-layer board... oh that rocks... we can use little SMT connectors for the BNC : ) it can be the oscope-monitoring devices...



ADCs:
   only a read-result system... 16 x 10 bit
   AD7918BRU -- $6.00 8 x 10 bit


UI: daughterboard is pretty much just generic IO, because the digital switch thingies (cheap)

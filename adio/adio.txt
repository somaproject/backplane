Pin Budget: 

32 digital input
32 digital output
1 clock input
2 boot input
~14 pins for ADC IO. 
13 Normal ADIO
2 LVDS input

Because of the reduced IO bank properties of the TQ144 part we're going to run all of the digital IO with 2.5VCC levels. The TTL converters should have no problem with this. 



Digital IO: 

We want 32 digital inputs and 32 digital outputs, all 5V-TTL. 


ADIO IO: 
everything shares the SCLK. For the ADCs we need: CONVST, SDO, RD.

For the DACs we just need SYNC, DIN.

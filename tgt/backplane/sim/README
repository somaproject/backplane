A test jig to test our ability to boot devices via syscontrol
and perform other necessary administration

Potentially a very long simulation. Each file we try and read has some
legnth. 

1. assert NICFPROG
2. open filename network.bit
3. read in all of network.bit's data and write it out the 
   NICFPGA interface
4. when done, try and talk to the NIC
5. next !

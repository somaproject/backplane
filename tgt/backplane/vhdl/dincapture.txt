This is a simple jtag interface to let us capture and then read out
packets that we RX.

We have a configuration that's 16 kB (8 blocks) in length. The jtag
interface can read out any of the 16-bit words via our standard
put-in-address/read-out-data scheme.

The DINEN increments an adder, and the falling dinen edge increments
the 1 kB boundary.

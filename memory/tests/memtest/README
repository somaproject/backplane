This is a test to see if we can actually read and write memory properly. 

It's also a verification of whether we can synthesize this thing or not. 

We have a simple interface which, in a ping-pong fashion:

1. writes a burst pattern to a row; 
2. reads a burst pattern from a row; 

we compare what was written and what we read back and: 
1. if there's an error, we flash a LED
2. for each bit in error we increment a counter that is read out via jtag


We generate the primary clock from the input 50 MHz clock, tripling it to 150 MHz and then passing that output through a phase-adjusting DLL.

This is a test to see if we can actually read and write memory properly. 

It's also a verification of whether we can synthesize this thing or not. 

We have a simple interface which, in a ping-pong fashion:

1. writes a burst pattern to a row; 
2. reads a burst pattern from a row; 

we compare what was written and what we read back and: 
1. if there's an error, we flash a LED


We generate the primary clock from the input 50 MHz clock, tripling it
to 150 MHz and then passing that output through a phase-adjusting DLL.

TEST LOG

Well, it doesn't work, and the entire board then proceeds to suck down 1.5A @3.3V. 

First, check stupid stuff. The memtesttest module works, and sets
LEDERROR =0.


Now, check the UCF File: Everything is correct. 

Do we need a resistor to terminate the fracking CK/CK-? Adding one, 100 ohm... no luck. 

Signals all "look good" with oscope.

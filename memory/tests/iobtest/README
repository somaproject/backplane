This is our test to make sure we understand how to properly use and
place the Virtex-4 DDR IOBs.

For DDR2 DRAM we drive out a differential CLK at 150 MHz and we also use a bidirectional differential Data Strobe (DQS/DQS#). 

My question here is, can I simulate/understand the : 
1. IDDR IOB with strobe
2. ODDR IOB with strobe
3. Switching between the two. 


Primitives: OBUFDS (p. 231) Differential input-output buffer that's tristateable

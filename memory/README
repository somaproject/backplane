Knowledge of the obsolecense of NoBL SRAM coupled with our desire for
higher-density packet buffering has pushed us towards using DRAM. 

Vimal says that I really want to do DDR2, as it has a very long
lifetime ahead of it, and that I'll want to avoid modules to make my
SI life easier. This is moderately unfortunate as we'll need to go
with a 5mil/5mil process for the PCB, but oh well.

THis is our unit test for our DQS-alignment locking interface. 

We repeatedly shift DQS relative to the CLK and attempt to acquire the
lock. To test our center-ing ability, we drive the DQ lines only in
the -exact center- of the period +/- some tiny (100s of ps) window. If
we fail to align properly, we'll read in the Zs and trigger an error.

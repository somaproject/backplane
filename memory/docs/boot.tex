The boot module takes care of all necessary initlaization requirements. 

The steps are as follows:

1. For 200 us, apply NOP and keep CKE high
2. wait 400 ns, apply PRECHARGE ALL
3. LOAD MODE to EMR(2)
4. LOAD MODE to EMR(3)
5. LOAD MODE to EMR to enable DLL
6. LOAD MODE to EMR to reset DLL
7. PRECHARGE ALL
8. >= 2 REFRESH commands
9. dummy WRITE
10. LOAD MODE with LOW to A8 to initialize operation
11. LOAD MODE to EMR to enable OCD
12. LOAD MODE to EMR to enable OCD exit

Parameters we care about: 

CASL[2:0] : CAS latency
WR[2:0] : Write recovery
ODF[1:0]: one-die termination
ODS: output rive strength
CASAL[2:0] : posted CAS additive latency


The operation here is of a giant state machine with lclke, lcas, lras,
lcs, lwe, and laddr all set by states. There's a counter, BCNT, that
we use for delay.

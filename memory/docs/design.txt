Our first test is "can we make the xilinx IOBs perform in a way which we expect?" I've not worked with the DDR IOBs, and the presence of the data strobe means that this part of the interface is going to be a bit tricky. 


Pin count: 

2 VRP/VRN
2 CK/CK#
4 CAS/RAS/WE/CS
2 LDM/UDM
2 BA0/BA1
13 Address
8 Data
2 DQS/DQS#

Total: 
2 LVDS Pair
31 single-ended

"if this was Bank of America DRAM, you'd have to share the address and data bus except on sundays and mexican holidays, whene everything is doen serially over the reset pin" -- Vimal

The DQS/DQS# strobe is asserted on the -edge- of the inbound data,
which somewhat sucks. So we need to use the IDELAY primitives and
perform an edge-capture to align ourselves. This is similar to the
method discussed in XAPP701(1.3)

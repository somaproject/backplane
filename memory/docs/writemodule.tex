The write module is responsible for: 

1. activating the relevant row
2. cycling through and issuing the relevant addr-line-based write burst commands, keeping them pipelined, and asserting TS at the correct time. 
3. extracing out the data from the two-tick write module. 
4. calling it DONE. 

We need to continue to dassert tristate for a few extra ticks at the end, hence the "EXTRATS" state.
